# functional lists: infinite list
# This uses a functional representation of lists: the functions for head and tail (hd and tl) return abort if their argument is an empty list. The abort supercombinator 
# just generates an infinite loop. cons is used to cons-truct a list and nil is the empty list

fcons a b cc cn = cc a b;
fnil cc cn = cn;
fhd list = list K abort;
ftl list = list K1 abort;

infinite x = fcons x (infinite x);
